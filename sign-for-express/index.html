		<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
		<p>This <a href="https://www.adobe.com/express/">Adobe Express</a> add-on provides a simple integration with <a href="https://www.adobe.com/sign.html">Adobe Acrobat Sign</a>, to simplify the sending of an Express asset for e-signature. It makes use of the following capabilities:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/">Spectrum Web Components</a> for the User Interface</li>
			<li><a href="https://developer.adobe.com/express/add-ons/docs/references/addonsdk/app-oauth/">OAuth 2.0 support</a> provided by Adobe Express</li>
			<li><a href="https://developer.adobe.com/express/add-ons/docs/references/addonsdk/app-document/#createrenditions">PDF Rendition support</a> provided by Adobe Express</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The add-on assumes that the user has pre-existing credentials to access Adobe Acrobat Sign and are permitted to create a new agreement.</p>
		<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
		<p>Please note that, as the Partner API Application used within Adobe Acrobat Sign is not currently certified, you will need to enable the following entry within the Security Settings of your account for the add-on to function correctly.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Allow Uncertified partner applications to access data from this account</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Once you have access to the add-on it appears as:</p>
		<img alt="Sign for Express add-on initial appearance" src="/images/add-on-start.png" width="856" height="656"/>
		<p>The add-on provides a step-by-step flow to allow the user to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Authorize access to their Acrobat Sign account, by clicking on the <code>Authorize</code> button to launch the OAuth 2.0 flow (check your browser, to ensure that pop-up windows are permitted)</li>
		</ul>
		<img alt="OAuth window prompting for credentials" src="/images/oauth-creds.png" width="712" height="824"/>
		<p>Once credentials have been successfully entered, the user will be prompted to <code>Allow Access</code></p>
		<img alt="OAuth window prompting for consent" src="/images/allow-access.png" width="712" height="824"/>
		<p>Following consent, the user can choose to render either the <strong>Current Page</strong> or <strong>Whole Document</strong> to PDF which, when completed, displays a button that allows the user to <code>Launch Acrobat Sign</code>.</p>
		<img alt="Render and Launch appearance" src="/images/create.png" width="856" height="656"/>
		<p>When the user clicks on the button, it will:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Upload the PDF rendition to the Sign platform</li>
			<li>Create a draft agreement using the uploaded document</li>
			<li>Open the draft agreement in a separate browser tab/window within which the user can review, adjust, and send the agreement as appropriate</li>
		</ul>
